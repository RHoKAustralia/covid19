This survey is for people aged 15 years or older who may have no symptoms or many symptoms of COVID-19. It takes about 7 minutes to complete. It was developed in Australia to help anyone in the world to improve their understanding of their symptoms and to help them track the symptoms over time.
        </div>

        <div class="content">
We invite you to complete the Symptom Checker to help you to see if you have possible symptoms of COVID-19. You can use the Symptom Checker just once or to follow your wellbeing over time. You can also help someone else to use the Symptom Checker.
        </div>

        <div class="content">
<b>The Symptom Checker can help you understand if you should seek medical advice. It does not diagnose COVID-19 and it does not provide specific medical advice.</b> If you need health advice, contact your local health authority or a medical practitioner.
        </div>

        <div class="content">
The symptoms of COVID-19 can range from mild flu-like symptoms to pneumonia (lung infection). Some people recover easily from COVID-19, while others may get very sick, very quickly. Symptoms can develop and change rapidly, so record your symptoms every day.
        </div>

        <div class="content">
Your identity cannot be revealed through filling in the Symptom Checker. We do not ask for your name, and the information you provide will be kept confidential. The information you provide will be used to help understand and control COVID-19 and provide advice to health authorities. This information could also be useful in the prevention of other pandemics; therefore we will keep the information we collect indefinitely to help us and other researchers in the future. By volunteering to complete the questions, you are not only helping yourself, but also your community.

        <div class="content">
        This Symptom Checker has been developed by a team of public health and information technology researchers based at Swinburne University of Technology in Australia, which is a public university. The project was funded by an internal university grant in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.
